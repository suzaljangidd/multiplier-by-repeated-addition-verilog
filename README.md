# Multiplier by Repeated Addition (Verilog)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Multiplier using Repeated Addition** in **Verilog HDL** based on a **Datapath and Controller (FSM)** architecture.

The multiplication is performed by:
- Loading multiplicand into register **A**
- Loading multiplier into counter **B**
- Repeatedly adding **A** to product register **P**
- Decrementing **B** until it becomes zero
- Generating a **done** signal when multiplication is complete

This project was fully **designed, simulated, debugged, and verified** by me.

## 🧠 Architecture
- Datapath + Controller separation
- Finite State Machine (FSM) based controller
- Fully synchronous design

### Datapath Blocks
- **PIPO_A** – Register for multiplicand (A)
- **B_CNTR** – Counter for multiplier (B)
- **PIPO_P** – Product register (P)
- **ADD** – Combinational adder
- **EQZ** – Zero comparator for B

### Controller
- FSM controlling datapath signals:
  - `ldA`, `ldB`, `ldP`
  - `clrP`, `decB`
  - `done`
